# 🏨 AtliQ Grands - Revenue Insights Dashboard

## 📌 Project Summary
**AtliQ Grands** is a premium hotel chain operating across India. Recently, they’ve been losing market share and revenue in the luxury segment. As a response, they turned to data-driven decision-making and hired a third-party analytics service (you!) to uncover business insights using historical data.

This project involves developing metrics, building a Power BI dashboard based on a stakeholder mock-up, and providing actionable insights to support revenue growth.
